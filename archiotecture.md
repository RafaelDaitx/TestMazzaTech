In this API construction, the focus is to make it as easy as possible,  focusing on getting our API up and running faster.

First of all, we have to see how our microservice will be. We have the client-side, who going to do a request to our API, and this API will request a data (or send) to our Gateway (it will allows us, protect our API Address and the we can scale application in the best way)
