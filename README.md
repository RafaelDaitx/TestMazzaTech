When designing and implementing an efficient microservice, it is crucial to go beyond the initial development and consider future optimizations and cost analyses, especially in cloud environments such as Azure or AWS. This document discusses improvement suggestions for the microservice, highlighting how to scale and maintain the solution efficiently. In addition, it explores the costs related to cloud architecture, offering a clear view of the financial and operational impacts.

The main goal is to be as simple as possible, to develop all the features we need first and put them into production.
